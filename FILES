This files gives a brief summary of what the directories are:

- DSL/ ... a domain specific language for embedding assembly at runtime
          (credit to Mathias Payer, extension to 64 bit by Enrico Kravina)
- loader/ ... a simple loader that is a (cleaner imo) reimplementation of 
             the linux loader (credit to Tobias Hartmann)
- progs/ ... a collection of miscellaneous test programs useful for 
             debugging or implementing new features (by Enrico Kravina)
- tp/ ... unit test like programs that can be checked automatically by typing
             ./test.sh (which will run them through lMem and compare results)
- test/ ... contains automated unit tests for checking instruction translation.
          (by Enrico Kravina). Also contains some tests of libdetox (by Mathias
           Payer) that would need to be adjusted.
- microbenchmarks/  ... contains some small programs that aim to test specific
                        performance characteristics (indirect jumps, ...)
                        (by Mathias Payer)
- tableGenerator/ ... automatically generates table based disassemblers for
                      the x86 architecture. (by Mathias Payer)
- lib/ ... the libraries that adds malloc guards for C programs 
           and "operator new" guards for C++ programs
- src/  ... the actual source of the lMem (by Enrico Kravina), derived
            from libdetox (by Mathias Payer with contributions by 
            Antonio Barresi, Marcel Wirth, Peter Suter, and Stephan Classen).
