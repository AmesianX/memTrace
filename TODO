Tasks that are still to do, in order of importance:

- Finish signal implementation
- Some system calls could be handled better
- Variable number of argument does not work!!!! (this is inconvenient)
- Separate more clearly the memory tracing from the core framework
- Implement more optimizations

Minor reminders
- action fail after interrupt fix (see string testcase)
