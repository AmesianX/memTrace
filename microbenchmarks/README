These micro benchmarks test and report the overhead of all control flow transfer
types.

Make sure that the #export CFLAGS += -DHIJACKCONTROL is commented out (in
Makedefs). The micro benchmarks start the binary translator on demand and use
direct access to the internal data structures to get the necessary information.

You can also configure the security extensions to your liking.
